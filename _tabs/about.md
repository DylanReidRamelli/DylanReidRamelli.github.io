I am a Software/Project Engineer at AFRY Switzerland(Bellinzona) in the BSA (Betriebs Sicherheits Ausrustung) team developing project plans for telecomunications systems for federal highway projects(USTRA). I am also acting as the sole ICT consultant for different projects such as the procurement of an Off the Shelf software application for the canton of Ticino's office of treasury.
In University I worked as a Research Assistant in Prof. Rolf Krause's group for Dr. Patrick Zulian. Most notably I contributed to the various C++ projects to improve CI/CD processes that helped scientific code to run on both UNIX systems and Windows.

## Project Engineer, AFRY

* Planned and developed project guidelines to keep federal highway IT infrastructure projects on track. Some key projects included the Mappo Morettina tunnel renovation and the A2 highway renovation (POLUME)—a massive project with a 2 billion Swiss franc budget. I also led the on-site IT infrastructure renovation for the A2 highway in the Bellinzona region.
* Worked as an ICT consultant on the procurement of a "Standard IT Application" for the Canton of Ticino’s Treasury Office, which handles and pays out over a billion Swiss francs in invoices each year. The goal was to find an ERP solution that improved security, integrated smoothly with existing systems, and leveraged machine learning and AI to predict future payments.
* Researched and recommended operating system migrations to boost performance and user experience on a United Nations renovation project.


## Research Assistant, Universita della Svizzera Italiana

* I collaborated on the creation of a frontend interface for U.T.O.P.I.A an embedded domain specific language designed for parallel non-linear solution strategies and finite element analysis. [Link to Utopia bitbucket project](https://bitbucket.org/zulianp/utopia/src/master/)
* I collaborated on the research project FRANETG "Fracture Network Growth". The focus was on restructuring the entire CMake project to improve CI/CD.

# Personal Interests
In my spare time I like to spend it outside of the house going paragliding in the alps, ski touring when it is winter or go for a good run. When I have time at home I like to play some videogames such as Elden Ring and other Souls-Likes, indies like Inside, NEVA, Pentiment. Otherwise I like to learn new things in the area of Copmuter Graphics and Game Development. As of now I am slowly going through the Real-Time Rendering book by Tomas Akenine-Moller and others and I plan to post about my progress in this website. I also plan to create small computer graphics projects using Vulkan and OpenGL, which I will then post on this site.
