I am a Software/Project Engineer at AFRY Switzerland(Bellinzona) in the BSA (Betriebs Sicherheits Ausrustung) team developing project plans for telecomunications systems for federal highway projects(USTRA). I am also acting as the sole ICT consultant for different projects such as the procurement of an Off the Shelf software application for the canton of Ticino's office of treasury.

In University I worked as a Research Assistant in Prof. Rolf Krause's group for Dr. Patrick Zulian and have worked extensively in different areas. Most notably I contributed to the various projects C++ and CMake code to improve CI/CD processes that helped scientific code to run on both UNIX systems and Windows
