In this blog I will be showcasing different milestones in the development of a Grand Archive TCG game made in Godot.
This is a pure passion project and a way for me to familiarize myself with Godot and Game Development in general and once done, it will be available completely for free.
It will probably be deployed as a Web-based game so that players will be able to enjoy it without having to download the game explicitly.

# Milestone - 1 - GATCG Deck Viewer Godot Node.
In this milestone I was able to create a UI-Node that will automatically load in a Scroll container the cards from a preselected starter deck, that of Kongming.
