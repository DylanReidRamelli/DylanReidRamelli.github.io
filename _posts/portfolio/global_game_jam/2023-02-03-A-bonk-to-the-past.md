# 404 Team

During the 2023 Global Game Jam, my improvised team of the weekend and I were able to create a small arena 2D action game called " A Bonk to the Past". This edition's theme was "Roots".
Although the game was not complete by the end of the hackathon, we had an amazing time developing it and learning new tools in Unity to bring the 2D sprites to life. 

I was in charge of programming the gamplay in Unity: Movement, Animation, Lighting 2.5D effect similar to Octopath Traveller.
