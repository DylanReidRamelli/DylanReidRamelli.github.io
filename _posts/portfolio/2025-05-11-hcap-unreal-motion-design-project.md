# Motion graphic for hockey games
The inital idea of this project is to create a motion graphic video for the 
derby game between HCAP and HCL. By leveraging the power of Unreal Engine Motion graphics and maybe even broadcasting capabilities I want to create an animation of the two team's logos fighting on
ice.
